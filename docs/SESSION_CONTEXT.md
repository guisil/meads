# Session Context — MEADS Project

## What this file is

Standalone context for resuming work on the MEADS project. Contains everything
needed to continue even without memory files or prior conversation history.

---

## Project Overview

**MEADS (Mead Evaluation and Awards Data System)** — Spring Boot 4 + Vaadin 25
(Java Flow) + PostgreSQL 18 web app for managing mead competitions. Uses Spring
Modulith for modular DDD architecture, Flyway for migrations, Testcontainers +
Karibu Testing for tests. Full conventions in `CLAUDE.md` at project root.

**Branch:** `competition-module`
**Tests:** 496 passing (`mvn test -Dsurefire.useFile=false`)
**TDD workflow:** Two-tier (Full Cycle / Fast Cycle) — see `CLAUDE.md`

---

## Modules Implemented

### identity module (`app.meads.identity`)
- User entity (UUID, email, name, status, role, optional password, optional meaderyName, optional country)
- JWT magic link authentication + admin password login + access code login
- UserService (public API) — includes `updateProfile()` with ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country validation
- SecurityConfig, UserListView (admin CRUD with meadery name + country fields)
- ProfileView (`/profile`) — self-edit for name, meadery name, country
- Password setup & reset: `SetPasswordView`, `setPasswordByToken()`, `generatePasswordSetupLink()`,
  `hasPassword()`, triggers on admin role assignment, "Forgot password?" on login, admin "Password Reset"
- EmailService (public API) — `SmtpEmailService` (internal) with `JavaMailSender` + Thymeleaf HTML templates.
  Sends magic link, password reset, password setup, order review alert, submission confirmation, and credit notification emails. SMTP failure logged with fallback link (no crash).
  Mailpit for dev (port 1025 SMTP, port 8025 web UI). Resend SMTP for prod. 7-day token validity.
- **Status:** Complete

## What's Next

### Priority 1: Entry labels layout adjustments
QR code now renders correctly (was broken: ZXing TYPE_BYTE_BINARY incompatible with OpenPDF).
Additional layout improvements to consider:
- Review spacing, font sizes, and overall label aesthetics
- Verify QR code scannability at print resolution
- Consider adding ABV to label characteristics line
- Review instruction header formatting
- Test with various entry data (long names, many ingredients, etc.)

### Priority 2: Manual walkthrough (full redo)
Redo the **entire** manual-test walkthrough from Section 1. Previous partial run covered
Sections 2–8 with many fixes along the way; this is a fresh pass through all sections
(1–14) to validate the current state end-to-end. **Go through every test item without
skipping anything.** May produce bug fixes or UX improvements.

### Priority 3: Release creation
Create a versioned release (merge to main, tag, changelog) to establish a clean baseline
before deployment.

### Priority 4: Deployment
**Investigation complete** — see `docs/plans/2026-03-10-deployment-design.md`.
**Deployment checklist** — see `docs/plans/deployment-checklist.md` (step-by-step with
redeployment/rollback procedures).
Target: DigitalOcean App Platform + Managed PostgreSQL (~$20/mo). Needs Dockerfile,
Maven production profile, logging config, DNS setup, Resend email, and env vars.

### Priority 5: Auto-close + deadline reminders (deferred)
- **Auto-close** — automatically advance division from REGISTRATION_OPEN → REGISTRATION_CLOSED
  when registration deadline passes (scheduled task)
- **Entrant deadline reminder** — notify entrants who have DRAFT entries when the registration
  deadline is approaching (e.g., 7 days, 3 days, 1 day before deadline)
- Other potential: entry received confirmation, results published notification

### Priority 6: Internationalization (i18n)
**Design complete** — see `docs/plans/2026-03-10-i18n-design.md`. Implementation deferred.
Summary: Vaadin I18NProvider + Spring MessageSource, resource bundles, browser locale +
UI switcher (cookie/localStorage), entrant-facing views only (6 views), MJP category
translations via bundles keyed by code. ~100-120 strings to extract. No DB changes needed.

### Priority 7: Judging module
Design and implementation. Reference: `docs/reference/chip-competition-rules.md`.

### Priority 8: Awards module
Design and implementation, after judging module. Reference: `docs/reference/chip-competition-rules.md`.

### Priority 9: Full category constraint system (low priority — future competition)
Full field locking/validation based on category selection. Design doc: `docs/plans/2026-03-11-category-hints-design.md` (appendix).
Includes: sweetness locking (M1A→Dry, M1B→Medium, M1C→Sweet), ingredient restrictions (M1/M4E),
strength locking (M4S→Hydromel), ABV caps (M4S→7.5%), ABV→Strength derivation (universal),
carbonation locking (custom categories), and admin-configurable constraints for custom categories.
Requires: DB migration, admin UI for constraint config, cross-module data flow, server-side validation.

### Completed priorities
- **Configuration audit** — Properties reorganized, secrets in profile-specific files.
- **Email sending** — SMTP with Thymeleaf templates, Mailpit dev, Resend prod.
- **Entry labels (PDF)** — OpenPDF + ZXing, LabelPdfService, individual + batch download. QR code fix: ZXing TYPE_BYTE_BINARY → TYPE_INT_RGB conversion + nested PdfPTable for cell embedding.
- **Competition documents** — PDF upload + external links, admin Documents tab, entrant list.
- **Category code display** — Grid columns show code (e.g. M1A) with tooltip for full name in both MyEntriesView and DivisionEntryAdminView. View entry dialog shows "code — name" format. Entry creation filtered to subcategories only.
- **Category guidance hints** — Informational hint text below category dropdown in entry dialog. All 16 MJP subcategories have style-specific guidance (ingredients, sweetness, ABV). No field locking or validation.
- **Registration deadline** — `registrationDeadline` (LocalDateTime) + `registrationDeadlineTimezone` fields on Division. Displayed in entrant view, editable in DRAFT/REGISTRATION_OPEN. V4 migration modified in-place.
- **Admin order alert emails** — `OrderRequiresReviewEvent` published by WebhookService, `OrderReviewNotificationListener` sends alert to all competition admins.
- **Entry submission confirmation emails** — `SubmissionConfirmationListener` sends confirmation to entrant when entries submitted, with link to MyEntriesView.
- **Credit notification emails** — `CreditNotificationListener` sends email to entrant when credits are awarded (webhook or admin). `WebhookService` now publishes `CreditsAwardedEvent`.

## Design decisions
- **Any user can set a password via "Forgot password?"** — even users without a role that
  requires one (e.g., regular entrants who only need magic links). This is allowed by design:
  it's the user's choice, introduces no security issue, and once set, magic links are blocked
  for them (defense in depth). No restriction needed.
- **Entry limits changeable only in DRAFT** — once a division advances past DRAFT,
  entry limits are locked. This prevents unfairness from mid-registration limit changes.
- **Flyway migrations modified in-place** — since the app is pre-deployment, existing
  migrations are edited rather than creating new ones. This keeps migration numbering clean.
- **Country field on User** — ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, validated in `UserService.updateProfile()`.
  ComboBox with `Locale.getISOCountries()` in UI. Webhook enrichment from shipping/billing address.
- **Meadery name stays on User profile only** — no per-entry override needed.
- **`meaderyNameRequired` on Division** — boolean flag, changeable only in DRAFT status.
- **Email SMTP failure resilience** — catch and log with fallback link, never crash UI actions.
- **Token validity (7 days)** — private constant in `SmtpEmailService`, not mentioned in email body.
- **Competition `contactEmail`** — optional field, shown in password setup emails as reply-to
  and visible footer contact. Saved via `CompetitionService.updateCompetitionContactEmail()`.
- **DevUserInitializer uses EmailService** — sends magic link emails via `EmailService.sendMagicLink()`
  at startup. Emails are captured by Mailpit in dev. Password users (admin, compadmin) still log to console.
- **`spring.thymeleaf.check-template-location=false`** — prevents Thymeleaf view resolver conflict
  with Vaadin (Thymeleaf used only for template rendering, not view resolution).
  MyEntriesView shows warning banner and blocks submit (all + individual) when required but missing.

### Known UX items (deferred)
- After failed credentials login, page reloads at `/login?error` and shows error notification,
  but password field is cleared (expected browser behavior for form POST). Not blocking.

### Configuration
- **Properties reorganized** — `application.properties` contains only non-sensitive,
  environment-agnostic defaults (4 properties). Secrets and env-specific values live in
  profile-specific files (`application-dev.properties`, `application-prod.properties`).
  Test overrides in `src/test/resources/application.properties`.
- **Deployment env vars checklist** in `docs/plans/2026-03-10-deployment-design.md`.

## Key Technical Notes

- Karibu TabSheet: content is lazy-loaded. Must call `tabSheet.setSelectedIndex(N)` before finding components
- Karibu component columns: buttons inside Grid `addComponentColumn` are not found by `_find(Button.class)`
- `Category` has only protected no-arg constructor — use `Mockito.mock()` in unit tests
- `Select.setEmptySelectionAllowed(true)` passes `null` to `setItemLabelGenerator` — must handle null
- Service constructors are package-private (convention)
- `@DirtiesContext` required on UI tests that modify security context strategy
- `EntryCredit` is append-only ledger — balance computed as `SUM(amount)` via JPQL
- `WebhookService` constructor takes `@Value("${app.jumpseller.hooks-token}")` — property must exist
- Mutual exclusivity: user cannot have credits in two different divisions of same competition
- `@WebMvcTest` doesn't work in this Vaadin project — use `MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup(controller)` with `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)` instead
- String-based `Anchor` navigation for cross-module links (avoids Spring Modulith circular dependencies)
- Comprehensive logging: `@Slf4j` on all services, controllers, filters, listeners, guards
